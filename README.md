### Setting up Java Environment Variable Path

In order for this extension to work properly, you need to have Java installed and configured with the correct environment variable path. Follow the steps below to set up the Java environment variable path:

Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Java website: Download JDK

After installing JDK, locate the installation directory. By default, it is installed in a directory like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12.

Open the System Properties dialog:

On Windows 10, right-click on the Start button, select "System", and click on "Advanced system settings" on the left side.
On older versions of Windows, right-click on "Computer" in the Start menu, select "Properties", and click on "Advanced system settings" on the left side.
In the System Properties dialog, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

In the "System Variables" section, scroll down and find the "Path" variable. Select it and click on the "Edit" button.

In the "Edit Environment Variable" dialog, click on the "New" button and add the path to the JDK installation directory. For example, if the JDK is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12, add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12\bin to the list of paths.

Click "OK" to save the changes.

Once you have set up the Java environment variable path, you should be able to use this extension to compile and run Java code within Visual Studio Code.
